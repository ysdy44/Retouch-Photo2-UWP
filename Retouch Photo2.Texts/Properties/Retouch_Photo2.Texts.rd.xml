<!-- 
     Please only ever update the .template.rd.xml file and run the GenerateRdXml.cmd to update
     the .rd.xml file. The generate will call a tool which calculates the WinRT closure and it will inject
     all the necessary Type directives.
     The format of the .template.rd.xml file is:
     - It is copied to the .rd.xml as is
     - __Assembly element is replaced with the list of Assembly elements for all the assemblies
         which are listed in the AssemblyList.txt. Any additional attributes on the __Assembly will
         be added to the created Assembly elements.
     - __SharedTypes element is replaced with the Type elements for all of the types in the WinRT closure.
         This element can have any number of child elements Exclude which specify which types
         to omit even if they're found in the closure

     The tool is called WinRTClosureFinder and its source code is in
     https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/Default/_git/CoreFxTools?path=%2Fsrc%2Fapps%2FWinRTClosureFinder
